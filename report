For my project, I chose to make the stock market project. The client is written in react, and it connects to two API's: The server, and the Finnhub API. The server is a NodeJS server that is written with and uses express in order to serve the pages that it serves. The server also uses mongoDB to connect to a database, where all the user information is stored (and where caching ould theoretically be done if necessary).
